Organize and sort your receipts locally, use pandas power to analyze your
spendings!
But why? There are tons of Apps out there scanning and even some for receipts.
Sure, but here are the core reasons why I built this app. If they are important
to you, give it a try!

<u>Reason 1: Data Privacy</u>

Your receipts combined with some personal data are a pretty good estimator on
where you are and what you are doing. I prefer to keep that data locally. This
software will never *access and send* any of that data since it runs locally.

<u>Reason 2: Adaptability</u>

Receipts differ for region and even for supermarkets. Here, some of the more
common german stores are included. If something does not work, add your own
reader / parser!

<u>Reason 3: Data Analysis</u>

The data is saved in `hdf`-files for `pandas` and can be easily exported to
`csv` or any other format manually. So analysis is not limited to the few plots
available (even though the initial version has some important ones). You can
easily load all your data using a simple one-liner and run all the analysis you
want. If you find anything particular useful, let me know and I can implement
that.

## Current State of Functionality and Roadmap
- Prepare receipt images for `tesseract` including manual rotation
- Parse receipts from (german) supermarkets and read items
- Sort data into receipt specific categories and item specific groups
- Correct items, add important metadata
- Save receipts and organize them in a dedicated folder.
- Basic data analysis with plots
- Export data to various formats

Future

- More types of receipts and more languages
- Better analysis tools and more pretty plots
- Continuous UX improvements

## Installation
This is fairly easy, just run `pip install pybudgetbook`. Please note that a
`tesseract>=4` installation is required with Version `5.` being recommended,
the executable `tesseract` must be in the current path.

For macOS, I recommend homebrew for base installation and language packs,
running `brew install tesseract` and `brew install tesseract-lang`.

For Windows, precompiled binaries can be found and installed. Those not always
update `PATH` so I recommend checking that `tesseract` works in a console.

## Tutorial
First of all, it should be noted that any of the three main parts **Parsing**,
**Data Editing and Saving** and **Plotting** can be used independently. They
access the same data folder to have a convenient working experience but that is
all.

To get started, there are several options. First, if you do not have any
receipts and just want to look around the UI, you can create sample data to get
started.

### Sample Data Example

### Working with Receipts
To get started, you will need a receipt from a (supported) supermarket. Take an
image from the receipt as flat as possible, including all from the
header (for supermarket identification) to at least the total. Try to include
the date. JPEG is fine, iPhones are fine. Lateral crop to the receipt borders.
Straighten to make the text horizontal. This all takes a minute on any modern
phone.

Even better: Get your receipt as pdf from the store - but check that the pdf
has a separate text layer!

Then, hit the load button on the left and either load an image or the pdf file.
Start by using the arrow keys (while the cursor is in the plotting area) to
rotate the image so the text is horizontal. You can use shift to rotate in
larger steps. Adapt filtering until the text pops.

Mind that after rotation and filtering changes, there is a slight delay before
`tesseract` is started, so wait a few seconds and then take a look at the
extracted text using `Show->Raw Text`. This should show the text from the
receipt which, in the main body, a single article per line.

### Adding manual Data

## Pitfalls and current Limitations
The following points should be noted before usage:

### Current Supermarkets
Besides smaller stores and supermarkets which work with the general format,
currently the following supermarket receipts are tested:

- **Germany:** Aldi, DM, Rewe, Real
- **France:** Carrefour

The above list will get updates. Others might work out of the box or with very
little adaptions. Im happy to help.

### A Note on Language Settings
Currently language settings is split into two settings. The left selector sets
the `tesseract` language and the default language for grouping and matching.
The latter can be changed using the second selector (after activation). This
gives all options but can mess up your grouping data - use with care! (One
possible use would be shopping in a different country just a few times a year.)

If you want a new language, you will need to prove the following:

- A matcher pattern, initially a general one. See the `parser` module for
  the API.
- If not english or french: A set of default groups. They may be empty but at
  least the keys should be defined. Store them in a `group_templates/item_groups_lang.json`.
- Icons for the groups. You can reuse the existing or add new. Optional.

**Pitfall:** Currently, a `general_eng` parser is missing, so english will not
work. I will happily include this as soon as is get a receipt from an english
store.

### A Note on Tax classes
Tax classes are very country-specific and, at least in Germany, not even
standardized. Currently implemented is a number system which covers them the
best:
- Germany has `1`, `2` (and `A`, `B` will be converted to that numbers). Here,
  `1` is the high tax class and `2` is the low tax class used for food.
- France has `6` and `7`, maybe more that I do not know about.

**Pitfall:** The very common supermarket *Aldi* in Germany has the tax class
switched, e.g. `A` is the low tax class. This seems to be the exception so they
will get switched on reading. The switcher can be extended to other exceptions.

## More Information
### Good Scans / Images
- Have your receipt as flat as possible against a darker background.
- Images are scaled to 600dpi **assuming a basic receipt width of 75mm**. This
  is an option which might needs adaption. Scale is important for `tesseract`
  and also for some types of identification where a logo is matched.
- Try to apply a lateral crop fairly close at the receipt borders. Rotate to
  have the text horizontal.
- Take the image under good lighting (e.g. daylight). Low light effects and
  especially noise will lead to bad text extraction.

If this all does not work, you can try to use some other extractors and then
feed the pdf. E.g. macOS *Preview* can extract text from images and then create
a pdf containing the image and the text in a separate layer.

### Grouping
Grouping searches language specific (currently only german,french, english)
dicts which are consecutively improved from data (if you want to help, see
below). Tagging your articles will improve matching since on save the data will
be used for feedback (only in your data folder, not publicly). Feel free
to create issues / gists with your local dicts so I can merge them in if you
want to share your data.

Under the hood:

- Base dataset dicts are delivered for some languages with the package and
  updated from time to time with package updates.
- A User data dict with the same syntax is kept in the data folder and is
  updated with your data.
- On load, those will be combined (exclusive set()).
- Before feedback, article names will be split in groups. Too small elements
  will be removed. A possible `negative_match_lang.json` can be provided that
  is used to further filter the article names.
- Reduced article names will be fed back into grouping file in the user dict.

Currently, there are no AI or other complex models for matching due to a lack of
data. This might come in the future if enough matching data exists.

## Issues
### The receipt is not detected or the information is not parsed correctly
Check the following step by step. If you need more information on where to look,
run the functions and analyze the output without the UI (see also under the
hood). You can always look at the raw text output under `Show->Raw Text`
- Check orientation and rotation of image
- Check image crop
- Check filter result (text legible?)
- **Check raw text**
- Check detected supermarket. If not correct, set manually by entering and
  hitting the button.

### Still not detected?
- If your receipt type **is supported** and your **raw text** is recognized
  but not parsed, create an issue.
- If your **receipt type is not supported** and your **raw text** is
  recognized but not parsed, create a PR asking for the new receipt type. If
  you do not have the capabilities for a PR, create an issue and support the
  receipt image and additional information (the more receipts of a type,
  the better!)
- If your **raw text** is not recognized, you need to adapt filtering
  parameters. Check filtered output and use the API to improve (UI
  not supported). If there are better parameters, let me know via issues or PR!

## API Usage
You can always use the API in its base version, check `examples/api_read_receipt`
for a good start.

## Under the hood
1. Images are scaled, filtered and possibly manually rotated.
2. Text extraction using OCR by `tesseract`.
3. Vendor detection by either:
   1. Text search for a known vendor.
   2. Logo detection: Logo is filtered and pattern matched in the receipt (ToDo).
   3. Manual vendor setup.
4. `Regexp` based text analysis with receipt specific patterns (optional) and /
   or best fit for all patterns.
5. Sort and post-process data in DataFrame, article grouping, display data.
6. Feedback matching data to continuously improve grouping.
7. Convert and save data.
